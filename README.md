# SoundBar
Soundcloud in your Mac OS X status bar.

It's built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) ([Menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar)) and the Soundcloud API. Here's a really crappy preview of what it looks like now (stay tuned):

Current Status

Currently, it's hard to find the time to hack on this. I also know little to nothing about Atom.js/Electron and I would have to say the current documentation is at best, average. I simply threw together thia app structure in ~10 minutes. 

In the mean time, feel free to fork this and hack away.
